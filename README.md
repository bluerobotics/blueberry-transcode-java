Prototype, Java codebase for Blueberry message transcoding. This code is primarily used by code that is autogenerated by the Blueberry schema parser (https://github.com/bluerobotics/blueberry-schema-parser).

You can find the C equivalent of this project here: https://github.com/bluerobotics/blueberry-transcode-firmware

This is not ready for prime-time yet!
